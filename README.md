# Arimaa (Java)

## Overview
This project is a **Java implementation of Arimaa**, the strategy board game similar to chess designed to be simple for humans but difficult for computers.  
The game follows standard Arimaa rules, with players moving pieces on an 8Ã—8 board with the goal of getting a rabbit to the opposite end or capturing opponent pieces.  

This implementation focuses on **game mechanics**, including piece movement, captures, traps, and win conditions.
